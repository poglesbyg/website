            What exactly is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>?
            This notion of an original author is theoretically not possible.
            Different types of text. Constructing meaning of text. Readerly versus writerly text.
            Make the reader no longer a consumer, but an active particpant.
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=matthew+kireshembaum&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=matthew+kirschenbaum">Matthew Kireshembaum</a> writes about afternoon.
            How do we define the meaning of a text? How do we define the actual text? Colors. Font.
            There is never a fixed version of a text. Depending upon who reads it, but also when and where it is read. Cognitive make-up.
            Reader-response critism.

            "to write a novel that changes each time you read it"
            This novel has instructions that it follows. Pages and decisions are specific reactions and defaults.
